# HTML + CSS + JavaScript HTML

This is an illustration of how JavaScript adds interactivity to HTML forms.

If the form is completed successfully, you will see a Personalised thank you message.

The CSS and JavaScript can be seperated and put into particular files like you see in script.js however for this demo, the code that makes it functional is one file - index.html

The iframe-test.html demonstrates how to embed this form in another webpage.

### How does this work.
1. Fill the form
2. Click Send
3. JavaScript picks the filled details, attempts to send the info to the next with the use the fetch API. Then it shows a thank you message. But the details are not stored anywhere.
